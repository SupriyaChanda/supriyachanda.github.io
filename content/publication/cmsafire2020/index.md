#abstract: This paper describes the IRlab\@IITBHU system for the Dravidian-CodeMix - FIRE 2020: Sentiment Analysis for Dravidian Languages pairs Tamil-English (TA-EN) and Malayalam-English (ML-EN) in Code-Mixed text. We submitted three models for sentiment analysis of code-mixed TA-EN and MA-EN datasets. Run-1 was obtained from the BERT and Logistic regression classifier, Run-2 used the DistilBERT and Logistic regression classifier, and Run-3 used the fastText model for producing the results. Run-3 outperformed Run-1 and Run-2 for both the datasets. We obtained an F1-score of 0.58, rank 8/14 in TA-EN language pair and for ML-EN, an F1-score of 0.63 with rank 11/15.

abstract: With the relentless growth of technology usage, particularly among younger generations, the alarming prevalence of hate speech on the internet has become an urgent global concern. This research paper addresses this critical need by presenting an extensive investigation encompassing three distinct hate speech detection tasks across a diverse linguistic landscape. The first task involves hate and offensive speech classification in Gujarati and Sinhala, assessing sentence-level hatefulness. The second task extends to fine-grained BIO tagging, enabling precise identification of hate speech within sentences. Finally, the third task expands the scope to hate speech classification in Bengali, Bodo, and Assamese using social media data, categorizing content as hateful or not. Employing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques tailored to each languageâ€™s characteristics, this research contributes significantly to the development of robust and culturally sensitive hate speech detection systems, imperative for nurturing safer online spaces and fostering cross-cultural understanding.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: This paper describes the IRlab\@IITBHU system for the Dravidian-CodeMix - FIRE 2020: Sentiment Analysis for Dravidian Languages pairs Tamil-English (TA-EN) and Malayalam-English (ML-EN) in Code-Mixed text. We submitted three models for sentiment analysis of code-mixed TA-EN and MA-EN datasets. Run-1 was obtained from the BERT and Logistic regression classifier, Run-2 used the DistilBERT and Logistic regression classifier, and Run-3 used the fastText model for producing the results. Run-3 outperformed Run-1 and Run-2 for both the datasets. We obtained an F1-score of 0.58, rank 8/14 in TA-EN language pair and for ML-EN, an F1-score of 0.63 with rank 11/15.

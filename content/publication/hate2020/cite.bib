    abstract = "This paper describes the IRlab@IIT-BHU system for the OffensEval 2020. We take the SVM with TF-IDF features to identify and categorize hate speech and offensive language in social media for two languages. In subtask A, we used a linear SVM classifier to detect abusive content in tweets, achieving a macro $F_1$ score of 0.779 and 0.718 for Arabic and Greek, respectively."

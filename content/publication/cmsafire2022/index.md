abstract: Social media platforms have seen a significant rise in user engagement in recent years. More and more people are expressing their views and ideas on social platforms. There is an ardent need to develop an accurate system to classify text based on sentiments. In this paper, our team IRLab@ IITBHU presents a solution architecture submitted to the shared task ‚ÄúSentiment Analysis and Homophobia Detection of YouTube Comments in Code-Mixed Dravidian Languages" organized by DravidianCodeMix 2022 at Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2022. to reveal how sentiment is expressed in code-mixed scenarios. For task A, we used mBERT model and word-level language tag to classify YouTube comments into positive, negative, neutral, or mixed emotions. And for Task B, we performed basic preprocessing steps and built mBERT model to identify homophobia, transphobia, and non-anti-LGBT+ content from the given corpus. For Task A, our proposed system achieved the best result, securing the first rank for Malayalam-English and Kannada-English code-mixed datasets with the ùêπ1 score of 0.72 and 0.66 respectively.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: This paper describes the IRlab\@IITBHU system for the Dravidian-CodeMix - FIRE 2020: Sentiment Analysis for Dravidian Languages pairs Tamil-English (TA-EN) and Malayalam-English (ML-EN) in Code-Mixed text. We submitted three models for sentiment analysis of code-mixed TA-EN and MA-EN datasets. Run-1 was obtained from the BERT and Logistic regression classifier, Run-2 used the DistilBERT and Logistic regression classifier, and Run-3 used the fastText model for producing the results. Run-3 outperformed Run-1 and Run-2 for both the datasets. We obtained an F1-score of 0.58, rank 8/14 in TA-EN language pair and for ML-EN, an F1-score of 0.63 with rank 11/15.
